# Power Management Tower Defense
## Game Design Document
Version 1.0 - Game Jam Edition

### Core Concept
A top-down tower defense game where players must manage power resources to defend against waves of bugs. The game uniquely combines resource management with traditional tower defense mechanics through a day/night cycle system.

### Game Loop
1. **Day/Night Cycle**
   - Each "day" consists of two phases:
     - Prep Phase (Day): Players build/upgrade defenses while solar panels generate power
     - Combat Phase (Night): Bugs attack while players defend using stored power
   - Surviving a night advances to the next day
   - Real-time gameplay allows for dynamic strategy adjustments

### Core Systems

#### Power Management
- **Solar Panels**
  - Generate power during daylight hours
  - Base generation rate: 10 power units per minute
  - Can be upgraded to improve efficiency
  - Affected by placement (optimization opportunity)

- **Batteries**
  - Store power generated by solar panels
  - Base capacity: 100 power units
  - Can be upgraded to increase storage capacity
  - Act as power distribution nodes

- **Power Grid**
  - Towers must be within range of powered batteries
  - Visual indicator shows power connections
  - Power distribution radius: 5 tiles

#### Tower Types
1. **Basic Turret**
   - Cost: 100 credits
   - Power Usage: 5 units per shot
   - Range: 4 tiles
   - Damage: 10
   - Fire Rate: 1 shot/second

2. **Rapid Turret**
   - Cost: 200 credits
   - Power Usage: 3 units per shot
   - Range: 3 tiles
   - Damage: 5
   - Fire Rate: 3 shots/second

3. **Heavy Turret**
   - Cost: 300 credits
   - Power Usage: 15 units per shot
   - Range: 5 tiles
   - Damage: 30
   - Fire Rate: 0.5 shots/second

#### Infrastructure
1. **Solar Panel**
   - Cost: 150 credits
   - Generation: 10 power units/minute
   - Durability: 100 HP

2. **Battery**
   - Cost: 200 credits
   - Storage: 100 power units
   - Durability: 150 HP

### Enemy Types

1. **Worker Bug**
   - Health: 50 HP (increases by 5% each day)
   - Speed: Normal
   - Reward: 25 credits
   - Special: None

2. **Soldier Bug**
   - Health: 100 HP (increases by 5% each day)
   - Speed: Slow
   - Reward: 50 credits
   - Special: Armored (takes 25% less damage)

3. **Scout Bug**
   - Health: 30 HP (increases by 5% each day)
   - Speed: Fast
   - Reward: 35 credits
   - Special: Dodge chance (20%)

### Wave Progression
- **Day 1**
  - Wave 1: 10 Worker Bugs
  - Wave 2: 15 Worker Bugs
  - Wave 3: 10 Worker Bugs + 5 Scout Bugs

- **Day 2**
  - All bugs gain 5% more health
  - Wave 1: 15 Worker Bugs + 5 Scout Bugs
  - Wave 2: 20 Worker Bugs + 8 Scout Bugs
  - Wave 3: 15 Worker Bugs + 10 Scout Bugs + 2 Soldier Bugs

- **Subsequent Days**
  - Health increases by 5% each day
  - Number of bugs increases by 20% each day
  - New bug combinations introduced
  - Additional waves added every 3 days

### Economy
- **Starting Resources**
  - Credits: 500
  - Basic loadout: 1 Solar Panel, 1 Battery, 1 Basic Turret

- **Income Sources**
  - Killing bugs: 25-50 credits per bug
  - Completion bonus: 200 credits per day survived
  - Perfect defense bonus: 100 additional credits

### UI Elements
1. **Resource Display**
   - Current credits
   - Current power stored
   - Power generation rate
   - Time until next phase

2. **Build Menu**
   - Tower selection
   - Infrastructure options
   - Upgrade options
   - Cost display

3. **Wave Information**
   - Current day/wave
   - Enemy count
   - Enemy types incoming
   - Time until next wave

### Win/Lose Conditions
- **Win Condition**
  - Survive predetermined number of days (e.g., 7 days)
  - Optional: Endless mode for high score

- **Lose Condition**
  - Base health reaches 0
  - All power infrastructure destroyed

### Technical Considerations
- Grid-based placement system
- Pathfinding for enemies 
- Power distribution calculation
- Wave spawning system
- Day/night cycle timer

### Polish Features (Time Permitting)
- Weather effects affecting solar generation
- Dynamic music based on game phase
- Power surge events
- Special waves
- Achievement system
- Tutorial system

### Minimum Viable Product
1. Functional day/night cycle
2. Basic tower placement and power system
3. Three enemy types
4. Three tower types
5. Basic UI for resources and building
6. Wave spawning system
7. Win/lose conditions
